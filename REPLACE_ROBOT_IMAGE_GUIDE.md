   ```

4. Replace the existing `smart_robot.png` file with your new image file.

5. Restart the development server:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the current server (if running)
   - Run `npm run dev` to start it again

6. Open your portfolio at http://localhost:5173/ and verify that the Arduino Smart Vacuum Cleaner Robot card now shows the new image.
